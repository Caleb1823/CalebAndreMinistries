Proverbs 26 (Law of Attraction, witchcraft, Baal, Lazy, Fool)


Today I felt bored and I wanted to try the law of attraction again, the Lord rebuked me with Proverbs 26

donot listen to the person who is a fool and to not be lazy, also I opened up a chapter in  kings when I asked if the law of attraction is okay to use and I saw the name baal. So the Lord does not want me to do this pratice and I understand. if I want anything I have to come to the Lord or earn it by my self thru hard work in a job.  

God wants me to return back to my 3d life and I am okay with that. The Lord knows I have a lot of thought about using the Law of Attraction to make life more easier, but in the long run it will only cost me my soul.</P>

Malachi 1 (Lukewarm) 

The Lord hated Esau because he gave away his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of stew.

I see this as when the Lord gives us something and we dont appreciate it and we give it away. What the Lord gives us is sacred and should be cherished and looked after with great care. 

The Lord does not like it when we offer things to him that do not even mean anything to us. From this verse I can get this is a warning for Lukewarm Christians in another part of the bible. We must stick close to God and all means and be dedicated to him. It is not good just a half done relationship, it needs to be a full one to the Lord that is from the strength that we have. 

Of course this verse is just about offerings to God which was done by some old testament type of way and we do not need to make altars and sacrafice to God anymore because Jesus has already done that for us.

But if you read it in a way that means something to you at the time of your life it really sends a message.<p> 






<p>Malachi 2 (Punishment for Lukewarm) 

This is written to priests but lets take it for normal people for example. We must put our heart into our relationship with God and not take things lightly, he is our father after all. This verse talks about the punishment God sends on these priests for not making offerings to good that has come from our heart and strength.

These Priests have laid up weak offerings to God. God knows these priests can do better than what they are doing, you wouldnt give someone you loved something broken for their Birthday wouldnt you? That is what this verse talks about.</p>

John 13 (Sin)

Here Jesus talks about washing Peters feet, peter does not want his feet washed (John 13: 8). Jesus washing someones feet means that he needs to cleanse us from our sin. Sin is so vile to God and we must be ready to be cleaned by God or else we have no part in his kingdom.

Being cleaned by Jesus is vital and we can not clean our selves on our own. Peter says no to me Jesus washing his feet and this is the same as us saying no I do not want to stop my sinning and have the Lord cleanse me. We are all called to repentance and we must try our best to walk with God and have him cleanse us from our wicked ways (Acts 17:30). </p>

Isaiah 51 ( Gods message to me) 

The Lord helped me today to get rid of my beliefs about the world I had, I have felt the Lords presence really well today which is good. 

The day I wrote this I was back sliding a bit, but then I went for a walk to the beach and saw 3 doves in the Sky as I prayed to the Lord.

After that I felt a lot better and calmer and was able to think more clearly about the situation I was in.

In this Chapter the Lord is talking to people who chase after righetousness, In the new Testament Jesus says anyone who goes after righteousness will be fed (Matthew 5:6) . The Lord also protects his people like I knew today. 

Staying in Gods righetousness will keep us on a safe path in life, The Lord wishes for us to be righteous and we know that sin can be dangerous and lead us down bad paths in life.

The Lord was telling me in this as well too not focus on the earth but focus on him and I knew by doing this my troubles would go away (Colossians 3:1 ). We must as Christians keep our eyes on God if a situation looks bad we must trust in God for him to be able to do it for us. We walk by Faith not sight (2 Corinthians 5:7). The Lord can make anything happen if we put all our might and strength into trusting him.

I had a battle with Psychosis when I was 23 and it was because of God I got over it and am here today. If something is troubling us we should bring it to the Lord and trust hes there to help us. I found doing self deliverance and praying for healing helped me get over this.</p>

<p>John 20:29 ( Jesus, Faith, Discerning of Spirits )

This verse shows how the Lord blesses people who have believed in him without seeing him, todays generation is very faithless when it comes to Christianity, they say because they havent seen the Lord them selves they believe he is not real. This thinking puts our mind in believing the Physical world is all we have, it makes it hard for people to have faith as well.

I feel The Lord wants us to find him before he comes to us, it says that Jesus will knock on the door and come and eat with us if we invite him in, a lot of people cant sense Jesus at the door because they are not looking for him the right way. 

I found that the Lord would come to me better when I was really going after him and trusting him with all my heart. I had to totally surrender my self to the Lord and tell him I couldnt do it all on my own, when I did this I prayed for the spiritual gift of discerning of spirits (1 Corinthians 12:10) and I could easily tell when the Lord was in my prescence from the enriched senses he had given me.

The gift of discerning of spirits makes it easier for us to know the Lords prescence around us, it can tell us when Angels are around and when demons are attacking. We will know when the Holy Spirit is around or Angels are around by having a really light and peaceful feeling going thru us, a demonic attack is normally when we feel fear or anger or depression. 

I would hold my hand over my heart and pray feeling the warmth of the Holy Spirit in my chest and from the Discerning of Spirits would know when the Lord was with me.

It takes getting to know God more and you will suddenly be able to use this gift better.</p>

Psalm 103 (Gods goodness and New Age/Atheism, Rebellion)

I remember after back sliding in 2019 and leaving the Lord for a year my mother would pray for me for God to protect me from anything evil that may come my way, I was extremely rebelious during this season in my life, most of it was me being unaware of how the bible worked and not really putting much attention into it like I should have done.

I would come back to the Lord after months of talking bad about him and rebellion, he welcomed me back with open arms after all that had happen and he made sure the sins I was struggling with were easier to not do.

I had ran out of energy back in February 2019 not really seeing anything in the future, I fell into months of depression as I would try and brainwash my self as much as I could trying to disprove God, I never could convince my self though because the Holy Spirit was convicting me strongly thru out the whole time. 

I got into a bad relationship with someone in November of 2019 where some person I was with would introduce me to New Age thinking and Occult styled things. 

I did a lot of Divination and Meditations and tried opening my third eye, which is a hindu thing for seeing into the spitit realm. 

Until one night I watched a video about a girl who did do the third eye meditation and was tormented by demons for a decade without rest, it was a wake up sign from God to stop doing what I was doing.

I learnt a lot of things I wish I could unlearn about the world.

On July 1st I had enough of New Age and I became a Christian again, I understood God better now after all of that.

I thought being a Christian again would make my life boring but it didnt, I started to enjoy reading the Bible and praying, I found it way more wholesome than New Age after what I had done.

God had a plan for my life I just never asked for it properly. God is very merciful and longsuffering with me and I am greatful for knowing him.</p>

<p>Monday 2nd November 2020


Alot of times in our life we feel like God is far away from us and we feel like we don't have that energy in us to continue, in these cases we must do whatever we can to digiliently seek the Lord for his help.

The Lord is always watching over us and I feel the best way to get back to the Lord is to fast in anyway you can for the Lords presence, choose a period of time that feels right in your spirit to go with and try your best to seek the Lord while doing this.

Another reason the Lord may feel far away is because of a certain sin we have in our life or idol that is messing things up in our walk with God, we must seek to put the Lord first in all we can whenever we can and make time for him.

In times of trouble it takes prayer and the utmost faith in God for things to really happen well for us. The Lord always rewards faith and there is nothing he wouldn't do to make sure we are helped by him.</p>

Mark 2:17 (Sin)

Today we come to Mark and talk about Reptenance and sin thru my walk with the Lord I have came to realise that repentance is a must on our half. Sin can not be destroyed with the enemy operating in us, I combat sin by saying Psalm 59 and breaking off chains of the enemy comanding any demonic presence to leave the area. Once these demons are gone I pray for protection against the enemy and strength to follow the Lord.

I have found this is the best way to come against demonic activity in our lives. In the spirit realm there is a war for our souls There is a psalm that says angels emcampeth around us to deliver us from demonic attacks.

The book of Romans tells us a lot about repentance but I have sumed it down to being conqured thru deliverance and praying for strength and then midnight prayers. </p>

Matthew 15 (Jesus feeds 4000)
In this part of the bible we come to the part where Jesus feeds 4000 people with bread and fish. Matthew 15:32 stood out to me the most here and reminded me that because we are Children of God that we should have Faith in the Lord to take care of us, we have a verse here where The Lord is feeding 4000 people as they are hungry and he doesn't expect them to fast anymore because they have walked with the Lord really well.
There in pslam 37:25 the writer says he has not seen a person following the Lord begging after bread. Jesus had compassion to feed all four thousand of the people and it goes to show that since we follow after The Lord we have nothing to worry about and will always be fed, all it takes is faith in the Lord and walking with him as much as we can. When we trust in God he will meet all our basic needs to live.</p>
***********************************************
<p>November 7th 2020 (Puttin the Lord first)


In todays chapter we will be talking about the cost of discpleship with the Lord. Alot see this and think that they have to hate their family and friends but what it is actually saying is to always put the Lord above everybody else in our life. It is the Lord who gave us all these blessing in the first place and created our friends and family. We are still intsruted to love our Family and friends though.


This can work in anything in any way that has to do with Idolatry and making importance out of something more than our Lord. We always look for joy in other places in our life which can be dangerous if idolized. The Lord can give us as much joy as we need it takes a lot of spiriutal warfare and staying with the Lord in prayer and obidience.</p>


********************************

<p>November 10th 2020 (Prophecy)

Jesus went into the village and told his disciples to go forth and retrieve an ass with a colt on her Matthew 21:2-3. 

This verse lead me to think about what was written in revelation and how many warnings it gives us today and tells us all the things that shall happen in the end times to the world.

Thru out revelation which shows bible prophecy being fulfilled and Jesus giving prophecy that shall happen in the future when the world turns from it ways and goes into a real wicked and evil kind of dystopia we shall see unfold infront of us.

Perhaps the first thing Is studied in the bible was the fall of man and revelation which has a lot to do about spiritual warfare and end time situations. The number one thing to remember about the end times is that we do not know when it is gonna happen and nobody can predict it what so ever at all.

I do believe in the end time though the true Christians will be safe and unharmed when the rapture comes.</p>
****************************************

<p>12th November 2020 (repentance and sin)

Today we are in Romans 9:30-33 this goes along with Galaitians 5 as well and it is all about how repentance is done and how we can not do it on our own, true repentancce if thru following Jesus and putting faith in him hoping he can cleanse us of our evil ways.

The Jews tried to follow the Law by works and by doing it them selves and because of this they were never truly righteous because they did not have God giving them the strength to actually do it. We need strength from the Holy Spirit to actually stop sinning a sin. whatever we have problem with we can do it by doing a deliverance of a spirit that is hindering us in a certain area, where that being Levithan (Pride Arrogance and Rebellion) or Jezebel (Lust, Narcissim and spitfulness).
  I find the best way to come against a sin is to pray at midnight to God for protection over the next day and that the Lord would stop any demonic acitivty playing on in your life. When we full into sin we are being tempted by a demon sent from Satan and this is when we need to enter a season of spiritual warfare and pray to God at midnight for protection or before going to bed.
Thru this we are working with the Lord on obtaining freedom from sin and this is how it is suppose to be done.</p>
*******************************************

<p>19th November 2020

Hebrews 9:11-14 

This verse talks about Jesus sacrafice as being the ultimate tabernacle of all. In ancient Israel they would have a tent where people would go and worship the Lord and pray infront of giving sacrafices to God.

In the new covenant we do not have to give these sacrafices because Jesus had paid it altogether for us. 

Thru living with Jesus and pursuing him daily he can cleanse us of our ways and give us his divine will for our lives. Living thru faith produces good works (James) that is why faith without good works is dead faith.

Many lukewarm Christians today only use Christianity as a title and name for them selves, when The Lord asks us to be born again. Being born again means ultimately surrendering to Jesus and giving up your will for The Fathers divine will for us.

We must seek Jesus daily and pray daily and spend time with him in a relationship pursuing God and getting to know what he wants for us.

Over time his will is going to make sense to us because we will be able to feel in our soul what he wants from us. If you have a desire that is matched up to Gods word then it would be from him.

We are asked to take up our cross daily and walk with Jesus. Pursuing Jesus will make our lives more happier and joyful. God knows what we need to be happy and live a good life. When we trust God with all our heart and strength we can relax knowing he will take care of us. 

This is far better than living a life of sin and depravity as sin is what is making us depressed and down. 

Trust in Jesus he will show us all the way. </p>
