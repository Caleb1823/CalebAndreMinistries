<!-- My story -->

<SECTION>

<article>
<p> My name is Caleb Andre Kissane, I am a web developer hoping to get a job helping a church who needs a front end web developer, I felt like it was my mission in life to do this as I had a passion for computers growing up.
</p>

<p> I was told that whatever God's plan is for your life, you will find it in your heart where God has put what he wants you to do exactly. For me I had an interest with computers and at the age of 21 I got an interest in coding. </p>

<p> I never wanted a normal job, I always wanted a job helping out Gods people and using my skills to push Gods plan for my life as far as I could go. It feels good to be able to help a Church/Ministry out and at the same time doing something that I love and enjoy.</p>

<p> I learnt all my coding skills on a website called codecademy.com where I would spend a time with God learning to code. It helped my relationship with God really well spending time with him doing something I love. </p>

<p> I have all of the spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit has given me and I have used them to learn to code and find a ministry that needed my help thru the use of the prophetic gift. I would fast for a few days and then the Holy Spirit would give me a name of someone who needed my help and could use a front end devloper for their cause.</p>

<p> Coding for me does not even feel like a job it feels like lesiure and is as fun as a video game to me. I get great joy knowing I can help someone with my skills and at the same time have fun doing it.</p>
